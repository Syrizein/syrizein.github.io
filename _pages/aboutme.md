## Quick bio

<!-- I'm a theoretical/computational chemist.

I was born in Sichuan, China in 2001. -->

Following Western name convention, Yunjie is my given name with Xu being my family name.   
I also invented a "preferred name" *Adrian* but it's actually less preferred as for now. I'd strongly encourage people to address my **birth name** instead.
