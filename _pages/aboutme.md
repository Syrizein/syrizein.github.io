## Quick bio

<!-- I'm a theoretical/computational chemist.

I was born in Sichuan, China in 2001. -->

Following Western name convention, Yunjie is my given name with Xu being my family name.  

I previously invented a "preferred name" *Adrian* but it's less preferred as for now. I'd strongly encourage everyone to address me by my **birth name** instead.
